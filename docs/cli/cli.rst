Command Line Interface
======================

The command line tool provides an easy way to

- train linear classifiers or neural networks
- evaluate with the trained model
- select hyper-parameters

To see how to train, evaluate and do hyper-parameter search (for neural network) ,
go to the following sections for more information.
