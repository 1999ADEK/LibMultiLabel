Using Linear Methods
====================

The linear methods are powerful in multi-label classification not only for small label problems but also for extreme multi-label learning (e.g., `PECOS <https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05878>`_, `Bonsai <https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08249>`_, `Smart Initialization <https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13122>`_). Here we show a practical guide to linear methods for multi-label classification.
